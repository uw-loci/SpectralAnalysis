Code for spectral separation for Fiber based spectral FLIM project

This project is aimed at quantifying the delay produced by LOCI fiber FLIM project. Although SPCImage can be used to track delay, but matlab is more accurate in finding the delay and will allow further post-processing. It uses bioformat to open the SDT file.
